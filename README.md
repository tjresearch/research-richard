# Decentralized Traffic Detection

## Project overview
I will simulate a road network and test the effectiveness of decentralized traffic detection (DTD) through car-to-car communication of local slowdowns. I will also determine the minimum density of DTD users necessary for effective decentralized traffic detection.

## Requirements
Ensure that your device has C++11 or higher.
